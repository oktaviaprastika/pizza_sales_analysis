# Pizza Sales Analysis

### 1. Project Overview

This project aims to analyze pizza sales data from 2015. The main objective of this analysis is to identify trends, top-selling products, and the most frequently used ingredients, in order to provide business insights that can support decision-making.

### 2. Tools & Technology

* **Database**: MySQL
* **Data Manipulation & Analysis**: SQL
* **Visualisasi & Dashboard**: Power BI Desktop

### 3. Data Source

The dataset used is containing information about product sales and transactions in 2015.

### 4. Key Analysis Steps

In this project, I performed several key data analysis steps:
* **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Using SQL to split the comma-separated pizza_ingredients column into separate rows, which allows for a deep analysis of ingredient popularity.
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Calculating important metrics such as total revenue, total orders, and average revenue per order.
* **Sales Trend Analysis**: Analyzing sales patterns based on time (daily, monthly, and hourly) to identify peak sales periods.
* **Product Performance**: Identifying the top 5 best-selling pizzas, sales by size and category, and the most frequently used ingredients.

### 5. Key Insights

Here are a few of the key insights presented in the interactive dashboard:
* **Peak Hours**: The highest sales occur during the midday and afternoon hours.
* **Most Popular Product**: 'The Classic Deluxe Pizza' is the best-selling pizza, while the 'L' size is the most preferred.
* **Popular Ingredients**: Ingredients such as 'Garlic', 'Tomatoes', and 'Red Onions' are customer favorites.
* **Busiest Days**: Weekends, particularly Fridays and Saturdays, are the days with the highest sales.
